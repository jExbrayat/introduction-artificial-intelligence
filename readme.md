# Introduction to artificial intelligence course

This repository contains a practical tutorial I made during the course *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* given by Pierre Latouche at the Universit√© Clermont Auvergne in 2024.  

I advise to read the [html report](https://jexbrayat.github.io/introduction-artificial-intelligence/) from which you can download the subject.
